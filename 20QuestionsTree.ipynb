    "# The Game\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you haven't watched the video about playing 20 questions against a computer using the Tree to help the computer ask you questions, this assignment probably won't make sense. Finish the lessons and come back.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the 20 questions game work correctly, you will need to add the functionality of interacting with the provided btree class, followed by the logic of the game itself. This assignment is slightly different from earlier assignments as we are not dealing with input files, and now have user input and output. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the notebook easier to understand, each portion is labeled as a new section. All of the code for interacting with the question/answer tree comes first, and each section has autograded tests. The code of these tests are generally hidden to keep from confusing you, as they interact with the tree in a different way than you should interact with it (this is the nature of testing code with data structures in Python). The comments in each cell tell you what the test is testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may add cells to experiment with your functions wherever you see fit. But the requested functions must be filled in inside the provided cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing your final game, you have access to two saved game files: `/data/CS703/animalgame.txt` and `/data/CS703/plantgame.txt`. You can use these as input to your game, or you can create your own if you would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Overall process of the game\n",
    "\n",
    "The very last code you'll write is the code to play the game, which will use the functions you write above it. You should read over that section first to make sure you understand what you are trying to do. The overall flow of the game is essentially the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in file containing pre-order traversal of game tree\n",
    "2. Build BTree tree to represent game from this data\n",
    "3. Play the game as many times as the user wants\n",
    "  1. Tell them what game they are playing\n",
    "  2. While you haven't reached an answer, keep asking questions and moving through the tree based on the user's yes/no answers\n",
    "  3. Once you are at an answer, guess that answer by outputting it to the user\n",
    "  4. Ask the use if you are correct\n",
    "  5. If you are wrong, it's time to update the tree:\n",
    "    1. Ask the user what the answer should have been\n",
    "    2. Ask for a question that would have gotten you that answer from where you were in the tree, such that the correct answer was the \"yes\" answer and the answer you had guess was the \"no\" answer\n",
    "    3. Update tree with this new question/answer\n",
    "  6. Reset the game and ask the user if they want to play again\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Write\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the autograder tests the notebook looks long, but there's only a few cells where you are writing any code. The overall program is actually fairly short. You will be writing the following code in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup function: This function takes the game in a pre-order list (NOTE: file reading happens elsewhere), and turns it into a BTree following the algorithm provided in the lessons.\n",
    "2. Next_node function: This function returns the next node for consideration as the game is being played.\n",
    "3. add_object: This function allows you to modify the tree that is being used as the game is played, when the computer guesses the wrong answer in the game (step 3.E above)\n",
    "4. Code for reading in the file and storing it into the name variable and the pre-order list\n",
    "5. Complete the code for playing the game. There are comments to guide you through the above steps, and some code is provided for you."
